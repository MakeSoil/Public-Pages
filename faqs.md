# What is MakeSoil?

MakeSoil is an online platform powering a global movement to make soil together on a planet-saving scale. Redefining composting as making soil, Soil Makers can easily and safely post their Soil Sites to our online map, and invite their neighbors and friends to contribute their food and yard scraps. Anyone, anywhere in the world, can use MakeSoil to find Soil Makers near them or start a Soil Site themselves. Together, we can reduce food waste, restore nutrients to our food, capture carbon in the ground, and beautify our neighborhoods.

MakeSoil is a Nonprofit Organization. We re-invest any surplus funds back into our mission.

# Why make soil?

#### Build Resilient Communities

Healthy soil has become rare and valuable in today’s world. By making soil together ourselves, out of the food and yard scraps in our own neighborhoods, we can save money and even generate new income and jobs. We can also use this soil to grow our own healthy food, becoming more self-sufficient and less reliant on the fragile industrial food system.

#### Transform Your Understanding

Watching our food and yard scraps turn back into living soil (instead of just throwing them in the trash), completes an essential feedback loop which transforms our understanding and relationship with our surroundings. Not only does this boost our personal sense of wellbeing, but we also begin to realize more fully how our current system works as a whole, and the role we play in this system as individuals.

#### Regenerate The Planet

We need to start regenerating the planet, rather than simply consuming it as a raw material. Our society produces an enormous amount of food waste. Currently, nearly all of it goes to landfills where it rots, releasing CO2 and methane — an even worse greenhouse gas. When instead we turn that food waste into soil, the carbon and nutrients go into the ground, capturing carbon, while producing the topsoil our food system depends on.

# Why make soil, when I already have a municipal compost pick-up service?

Watching your food waste turn back into living soil completes an essential feedback loop which suddenly transforms your understanding and relationship with the environment. When somebody else takes away your food waste and deals with it for you out of sight, you miss out on this transformative experience that can only come through completing such feedback loops.

We live today in a box and bin culture. We click a button on the internet, a box arrives on our doorstep, we play with it for a while or it breaks, and then we throw it in a bin and someone takes it away. This keeps us from understanding the system we live in as a whole. MakeSoil is founded on the insight that it’s only by witnessing and fully participating - from start to finish - in regenerative acts like soil-making, that we can begin to truly recognize how our system works, and the role we play in this system as individuals.

Turning your food waste into soil yourself in your backyard, or with your neighbors locally, is also more energy-efficient. Municipal pick-up services are industrial operations that use big trucks to haul the materials over to the nearest processing facility, where then yet more heavy machinery is used to turn the piles. And given that most of the food waste being picked up is, in terms of mass, actually water, this all uses up far more energy than dealing with your own food waste in your neighborhood.

Finally, municipal pick-up programs are not free — citizens pay for them in taxes and fees. If instead we step into our role as Soil Makers and make soil together in our own neighborhoods, we can save that money and even generate income. We can take what is a municipal obligation, and turn it into home-based jobs for thousands of people.

# What is a Soil Maker?

A Soil Maker is someone who knows how to turn scraps and leftovers into soil - or is willing to learn - and who operates a Soil Site where they invite one or more neighbors to participate.

# What is a Soil Site?

A Soil Site is a place where food and yard scraps from you and your neighbors are turned into soil by a Soil Maker.

# What is a Soil Supporter?

A Soil Supporter is someone who contributes their food and yard scraps to a Soil Site.

# What if I'm a novice Soil Maker? Can I still host a Soil Site?

Yes, absolutely. Remember that making soil - although essentially a very simple process - is a skill that very few people have so far developed. And since it’s so important for creating healthier, cohesive and resilient neighborhoods, there’s no better time than now to start learning.

You might want to let people know in the description of your Soil Site that you’re a novice and would love some help learning how to make soil. You’ll be surprised how happy people will be to help share their experience and expertise with you. And MakeSoil is also developing educational resources and support to all of our brave new Soil Makers joining the movement.

While you’re just getting started, you can also set your Soil Site as ‘Private’ - meaning Soil Supporters won’t start bringing their scraps to you until you approve them as participants. And you can set a limit to the number of Soil Supporters you accept (it could be as low as 1 or 2), so your Soil Site won’t get overwhelmed while you are still developing your soil-making skills.

# What if I don’t have access to garden space? Where can I host a Soil Site?

There are lots of places where soil can be made, even in a dense city. Even if you don’t own any land or property yourself, you may just need to be resourceful. After all, as you can see from the image of an urban Soil Site below, it doesn’t take much space to make soil. Could you get access to your neighbor’s yard, or a spare patch of nearby community land - perhaps some land that belongs to a church or local business?

# What if I travel a lot. Can I still be a Soil Maker?

Yes. It’s so important to make soil together, that we’ve designed the MakeSoil.org platform to be complementary with a diverse range of lifestyles - including that of today’s world traveller!

The platform facilitates good communication and builds trusted community around each Soil Site, so that even when you’re away, you can feel comfortable with people visiting your site.

If you choose to make your site ‘Private’, you can make sure that only individuals approved by you, the primary Soil Maker, can access and participate in your site as Soil Supporters.

You can also ‘promote’ a Soil Supporter in whom you have lots of trust, to become a fellow Soil Maker alongside you who can manage your site and its participants while you’re gone.

# Can a project or organization create and host one or more Soil Site(s)?

The platform is designed to support both individuals AND organizations to create and host one or more Soil Sites. If you are part of a soil-making project or organization, you can post your organization’s Soil Site(s) to our online map while retaining your own identity on the platform, including a link to your website and any social media pages, and also your contact details.
